# Python 

This repo is a collection of data science project using Python. Detailed description and the link to each code file can be found below:

1. Finding the closest inaugural speech to Donald Trump's 2017 address using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
    * From the 58 inaugural speeches, which speech would be most similar to the address made by President Trump in 2017? A dataframe containing the dot product of term-frequency and inverse-document-frequency for each inaugural speech is created. With this dataframe, the closest inaugural speech is computed based on cosine similarity. As a result, inaugural speech made by President Clinton in 1993, President Bush's speech in 2005 and President Obama's speech in 2013 were selected as the closest speech to Trump's address.
